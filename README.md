# Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Based on Age, BI-RADS score and Mammographic Masses to Improve Healthcare Screening

## 1. Introduction 
It is estimated that breast cancer is the most common cancer, with the highest incidence, mortality, and prevalence in women, worldwide [1]. Since 1985 research and treatments have rapidly evolved, alongside the introduction of mass screening. Early detection has played a vital role in catching breast cancer in-situ stage 0 or localised stage 1. Currently, 99% of breast cancer patients survive for more than five years if discovered during stages 0 â€“ 1. The drastically lowered mortality rates from the late 1980s are portrayed in Figure 1; this was partly due to the adaption of mammography screening [2][3].
